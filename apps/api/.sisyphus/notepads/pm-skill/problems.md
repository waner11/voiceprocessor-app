# Problems - PM Skill

## [2026-01-24 23:18] Task 4: Manual Testing Cannot Be Automated

**Problem**: Task 4 requires manual interaction with OpenCode Prometheus agent to verify skill triggering.

**Impact**: Orchestrator cannot complete this task autonomously.

**Workaround**: 
- Skill files created and committed successfully
- Testing instructions documented in learnings.md
- User must manually verify skill integration

**Status**: UNRESOLVED - requires user action

**Next Steps**:
1. User opens new OpenCode session
2. User switches to Prometheus agent
3. User tests PM skill trigger with feature request
4. User verifies override behavior
5. User provides feedback if skill needs adjustment

**No other blockers encountered.**
